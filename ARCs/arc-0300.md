This document outline proposed standards and expansions to URI schemes and deeplinks in the Algorand ecosystem.

## Table of Contents

> TBC

## Abstract

This URI specification intends to extend ARC-0026 with backwards compatibility, standardize the URI scheme used by wallets, and introduce new URI methods for importing accounts, wallet interfaces (i.e. Wallet Connect [maybe?]) and wallet deep links. 

## Motivation

> WIP 

> Something about "usability", "UX" regarding account backups, or quickly distributing accounts.
> Would also be good to mention participation keys, etc
> I'll need to re-work my preamble regarding deeplinks on mobile platforms and apps and how each wallet seems to support it's own URI scheme

## Specification

> WIP

### ABNF grammar

```abnf
algorandurn     = "algorand://" algorandpath [ "?" algorandparams ]
algorandpath    = accountpath / importpath / algorandaddress
accountpath     = "account/" accountname
importpath      = "account/import/" encryptedkey
accountname     = 1*(ALPHA / DIGIT / "." / "-" / "_")
encryptedkey    = *qchar
algorandaddress = *base32

algorandparams  = algorandparam [ "&" algorandparams ]
algorandparam   = [ amountparam / labelparam / noteparam / assetparam / typeparam / encodingparam / otherparam ]
amountparam     = "amount=" *DIGIT
labelparam      = "label=" *qchar
assetparam      = "asset=" *DIGIT
noteparam       = (xnote | note)
xnote           = "xnote=" *qchar
note            = "note=" *qchar
typeparam       = "type=" ( "address" / "nfd")
; TODO - Add other encodings to `encodingparam`
encodingparam   = "encoding=" ( "base64url" / otherencodings ) 
otherparam      = qchar *qchar [ "=" *qchar ]
```

### Technical Details
(Delve into the technical aspects of the ARC, including algorithms, data structures, and cryptography. Be as specific as possible.)

### Rationale
(Explain the rationale for the proposal. Discuss any trade-offs, design decisions, and the benefits of this approach over other alternatives.)

## Backwards Compatibility

> WIP
> Note that wallet's should maintain backwards compatibility with ARC-0026

## Security Considerations

> WIP
> I think account backups should default to being password protected, but there's a great use case for not with what amounts to "account airdrops" and there only being small amounts (on testnet even), but a strong case for why "clear text" should be an option, especially as it introduces a potentially destructive action.
